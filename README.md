# A-hybrid-Multiscale-Multilevel-approach-on-hyperparameter-optimization-in-CNN
Project Title: Hybrid Multiscale and Multilevel Hyperparameter Optimization for CNNs
Project Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop and demonstrate a hybrid approach for hyperparameter optimization in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This approach combines the power of Gaussian Process-based Bayesian Optimization with a Multilevel Evolution Optimization technique. The aim is to leverage multiscale and multilevel strategies to fine-tune CNN hyperparameters effectively and efficiently, thereby enhancing model performance and generalization.

Key Components:
Random Search Optimization:
Random Search is used to show how it is an inefficient method and that much better algorithms are required for the setting of hyperparameters.

Gaussian Process-based Bayesian Optimization:
Gaussian Process (GP) models are utilized to create a probabilistic surrogate for the CNN's performance.
Bayesian Optimization techniques guide the search for optimal hyperparameters by balancing exploration and exploitation.

Multilevel Evolution Optimization (MLEO):
MLEO is a modified genetic algorithm that incorporates both within-group and between-group dynamics.
It offers an exhaustive search strategy, ensuring a comprehensive exploration of the hyperparameter space.
MLEO aids in mitigating the risk of overfitting by searching for hyperparameters that lead to stable and robust CNN models.
